# Coralizer Firefox Extension

The purpose of this extension is to enable some features on third party solutions
like Facebook Comments, Disqus or Livefyre.

## First prototype

This is on a very early stage, it's just the basic building blocks and some HTML mockups.

To get started, clone this repo and follow the steps on this guide to install the Jetpack tool from Mozilla:

Once installed, simply run:

`jpm run`

to open a new Firefox window with the add-on installed.
